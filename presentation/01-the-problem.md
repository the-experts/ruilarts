# The Problem

## When People Move, Healthcare Access Suffers

---

### Scenario

**Person A** just moved to Amsterdam
- Has a huisarts in Rotterdam (now far away)
- Needs a huisarts in Amsterdam
- But Amsterdam practices are full 😞

**Person B** just moved to Rotterdam
- Has a huisarts in Amsterdam (now far away)
- Needs a huisarts in Rotterdam
- But Rotterdam practices are full 😞

### The Issue

🏥 **Individual swaps are hard to coordinate**
- People don't know who wants their practice
- No central matching system
- Manual coordination is time-consuming
- Many people stay stuck with distant doctors

---

### The Opportunity

💡 **What if we could match multiple people in a circle?**

**A → B → C → D → A**

Everyone gets what they want!
